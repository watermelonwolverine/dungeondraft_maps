# About
Created for the Wyvern Tor orc camp of the LMoP adventure but can also be used as a generic cave hideout.

If you are using FoundryVTT I recommend using Levels (https://github.com/theripper93/Levels) for this map.

# Entrances

The players can enter:

- Through the front door
- Through the stream and waterfall 
- Through the hole on the top

# Goals

Kill what ever resides within the cave.

# Recommendations

I put many strong mobs in the cave - far too many to deal with in a normal fight so the players need to get creative. 

I used:

- A orc war chief
- 3 worgs
- A dozen orcs
- An ogre

They could for example plug the entrance and the stream to flood the cave and drown them all. Or they could plug the front entrance and smoke them out.

I recommend giving the players some hints that there is a small horde hiding in there so they don't barge through the front door and get mowed down.
