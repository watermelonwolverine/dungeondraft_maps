# About

Created for the Old Owl Well of the LMoP adventure but can also be used as a generic cave hideout.

Old Owl Well was once a trading outpost created by the ancient Netheril empire which built the tower and the well.  
From the tower only ruins remain but the underground cave remained almost untouched until Hamun Kost found the buried pathway down.


# Goals

There are two possible goals: 

1. The characters came to investigate rumors of zombies in this area
2. The characters came to restore the well to improve trading relations between Phandalin and settlements to the east

To get to the pump they need to do two things:
- Find the magical crystal (1) that acts as energy source for the pump
- Open the door [3.1] to the room with the pump

# Objects

- (1) Magical crystal that acts as energy source for the pump. It can be used to restart the pump [3.2]
- (2) Red glass stone the fits into the gargoyle's eye socket [4.2]
- (3) Keys for the door of the old barracks [4.1]. 

# Creatures

- {1} Hamun Kost
- {2} Hamun's zombies
- {3} Umber Hulks

# Rooms

## [1] Central hub

Hamun and his zombies are in this room {1}{2}. While the zombies are using pickaxes to hack their way into the adjacent rooms Hamun Kost sits at his table, frustrated that they take to long.  
This doesn't have to end in a fight but Hamun is not friendly and will not let the characters take anything of value without a fight.

## [1.1] North west entrance
A trap is waiting for anybody who takes this route. What trap is up to you. Maybe it's just a string and a bell.

### [1.2] Camp in the center of the room
Hamun's camp. The scrolls and the books should tell a bit about:
- The ancient Netheril empire.
- The construction of Old Owl Well
- What Hamun is searching for. Maybe some foreshadowing to what they will find in the old barracks [4] at the altar [4.3]

### [1.3] Water reservoir
The water is fresh water. If the characters dive down a few feet they will find an underground passage to the monster lair [5]

### [1.4] Northern and southern passages
They are roughly 15 ft above the ground.  
Hamun hasn't explored them as he himself is a lousy climber and doesn't expect there to be anything of value.  
The characters may see that the passages were made by some large beasts, foreshadowing what they will find at the other end.

## [2] Storage room: Room in the north.

This room was used as intermediate storage room for traders that used Old Owl Well as trading outpost. It once contained food, fabric and spices but also slaves.

### [2.1] Doors
Both doors are made of wood and can relatively easily be picked open or destroyed.

### [2.2] Storage contents
Most of the things that were stored here are rotten and are now junk. In one of the boxes the energy crystal (1) is hidden.  
Maybe also put something nice here for your characters.

## [3] Pump room: Cave section in the west

### [3.1] Door
The door is made of metal bars and has no lock. It is opened by a mechanism which is triggered using the gargoyle head [4.2]

### [3.2] Pump
The pump is of ancient origin (Netheril) and worked until a few years ago. To get it running the characters need the replace the used up energy crystal with the new one (1).

## [4] Old barracks: Room in the south.

This room was once used by guards and traders for sleeping and praying.
If Hamun Kost is still when they open the door he will try and get in before them and loot everything valuable.

### [4.1] Door
The door is made of metal and has a hefty lock. The character can try to pick the lock if they fail they will have to find the key in the monster lair [5] first.

### [4.2] Gargoyle on the northern wall
The Gargoyle has one empty eye socket and a red glass stone in the other one. If they characters find the other glass stone (2) in the monster lair [5] they can put it in there which opens the door [3.1] to the pump room [3].

### [4.3] Small altar at the southern wall
The small altar is flanked by two statues and has a small chest on top. Put something valuable and magical in there.  
The two flanking statues could start moving when they loot the chest if you want to set this up as a trap.

### [4.4] Chests at the foot of the stone beds
Most of the contents are junk but a few precious items should be in there.

## [5] Monster Lair: Cave section in the east.

The lair can be accessed in two ways:
- Dive through the water
- Go through the northern or southern cave passages

### [5.1] Northern and southern cave passages
The characters have to climb down 15 ft to the bottom. If they want to do it quietly let them roll some stealth checks.  
From the southern passage the characters can clearly see the human remains [5.2].

### [5.2] Human remains at the north-east cave wall

Remains of one of last guards that were stationed here.  
With him lies the keys (3) and the red glass stone (2).  
Can be seen from the southern entrance [5.1]. Let character make a perception check to see if they see the keys or the stone from there.

### [5.3] Monster lair

This is the nest of umber hulks. Two are are here while one is out hunting. One of the present ones is a juvenile and relatively weak. The other one is an adult specimen.
The juvenile is gnawing on some bones while the adult on is sleeping.

The characters can avoid a battle if they successfully sneak past the umber hulks and/or manage to soothe the juvenile.

When they fight the umber hulks let the absent adult one join the fight in a later round.
If you want give your players some feeling of guilt let the juvenile die with some heartbreaking yell after which the absent umber hulk comes back.  
If you want to make the fight even more interesting give the adult hulks some boost after their young one was killed.  
If guilt and roleplay is more your style let the adult hulks end the fight to mourn their dead child.
