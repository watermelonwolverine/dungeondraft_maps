Multi-layered map. 

If you are using FoundryVTT I recommend using Levels (https://github.com/theripper93/Levels) for this map.

The players can enter:
1. Through the front door
2. Through the stream and waterfall 
3. Through the hole on the top

I put many strong mobs in the cave - far too many to deal with in a normal fight so the players need to get creative. 

I used:
- A orc war chief
- 3 worgs
- A dozon orcs
- An orge

They could for example plug the entrance and the stream to flood the cave and drown them all. Or they could plug the front entrance and smoke them out.

I recommend giving the players some hints that there is a small horde hiding in there so they don't barge through the front door and get mowed down.
